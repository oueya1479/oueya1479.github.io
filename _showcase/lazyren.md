  There's hardly a spot he didn't touch.

DaeIn took customization to the next level.
He used a ton of Hydejack's customization options, and then wrote his own HTML and CSS on top.

He wrote about [how to customize Hydejack](https://lazyren.github.io/devlog/how-i-customized-hydejack-theme.html) in his devlog,
where you can also find other Jekyll-related topics. [Go check it out!](https://lazyren.github.io/devlog/)

If you intend to use Hydejack with Korean, you can [see what it looks like](https://lazyren.github.io/review/various-keyboard-layouts.html) on his site as well.
