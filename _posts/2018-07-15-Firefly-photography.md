I'm very lucky that there are dedicated photographers who take beautiful photos and videos of wild fireflies.  I've also tried it myself, with less beautiful results, so I really appreciate the technical and artistic skill that goes into these photos. Here is a non-exhaustive of photographers who I've seen some great firefly media from:

* Radim Schrieber: [http://www.radimphoto.com](http://www.radimphoto.com) ; [https://www.facebook.com/RadimPhoto/](https://www.facebook.com/RadimPhoto/)
* Ken Nagie: [https://www.facebook.com/Ken.Nagie](https://www.facebook.com/Ken.Nagie)
* Spencer Black: [https://www.blackvisual.com](https://www.blackvisual.com)
* Alex Wild: [https://www.alexanderwild.com](https://www.alexanderwild.com)

Please consider supporting their work by purchasing some artwork if you see a photo that you like!

One of [Radim's pictures](https://www.facebook.com/RadimPhoto/posts/1935136113184278) is actually the sidebar on this website. Thank you Radim!

Here is a great *Photinus pyralis* (Big Dipper firefly) timelapse from [Ken Nagie](https://www.facebook.com/Ken.Nagie/posts/2164625460439510):
