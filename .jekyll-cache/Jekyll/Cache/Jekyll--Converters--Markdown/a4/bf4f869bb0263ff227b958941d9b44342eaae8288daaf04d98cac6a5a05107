I"Û<p>Welcome! This is my attempt at a new blog, and a proper personal website. Scroll on down to the <a href="https://photocyte.github.io/about/">about page</a> to learn more about me.</p>

<p>I think I started a blog way back in 2013 or so, with the whole effort of buying a domain + server space and installing all the software, but it turned out that I only posted a few posts &amp; the blog lapsed to the sands of time after I forgot to pay the server fee‚Ä¶  Hopefully, this blog will be more robust and more frequently updated üôÇ. Certainly this method (using jekyll and hosting on github), seems much more straightforward, and cheaper!</p>

<p>P.S. I‚Äôve also decided that I will use this page to keep track of the software that I‚Äôm using to edit this blog.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://github.com/qwtel/hydejack">‚Äúhydejack‚Äù</a> template/project I forked to make this blog</li>
  <li>Markdown editing: <a href="http://macdown.uranusjr.com">MacDown</a></li>
  <li>Syncing between Github &amp; local copy: git command line</li>
  <li>Serving a local copy: ‚Äúbundle exec jekyll serve‚Äù while in local copy directory. <em>note: while hosting jekyll will automatically update when you save a file. Nice!</em></li>
  <li>The jekyll posts have to be named with dashes ‚Äò-‚Äò not underscores ‚Äò_‚Äô</li>
  <li>The ‚Äú_drafts‚Äù folder is a great option to store posts in progress, and this jekyll command will serve it properly to a public IP:
    <blockquote>
      <p>bundle exec jekyll serve -H 192.168.0.13 -D ‚Äìfuture ‚Äìunpublished</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://imagemagick.org">ImageMagick</a> is a great way to quickly resize &amp; reencode images. I installed it with macports, and used this [bash script] to resize things (misc_files/post1/resize.sh)</li>
  <li>If you need to encrypt a file in a non obtrusive way (like for example, my CV) zip command line works pretty well:
    <blockquote>
      <p>zip -ej FILE_NAME.zip FILENAME</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>
